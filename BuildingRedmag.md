# Introduction #

Redmag is currently built using Eclipse. A better building approach would be needed when the project becomes larger.

# Details #

## Required libraries ##
Redmag requires several libraries to build. These libraries are not included in the distribution (except the MySQL Connector for Java). Versions given are the ones that have been tested. Earlier versions may work.

  * SVNKit >= 1.3.0: http://svnkit.com/
  * MySQL Connector for Java >= 5.1.7: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j

## Building procedure ##

**FIXME: Write this :)**
